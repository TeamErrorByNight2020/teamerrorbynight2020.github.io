## About Us

Team Error by Night consists of M. Morella, B. Ulrich, B. Cadman, and E. Virani.

During the fall semester of 2020, we designed a pizza ordering system, for Introduction to Software Engineering at Kennesaw State University.

## The Pizza Project

This class tasked our group with engineering an electronic web  ordering system for Mom & Pop's Pizzeria, a fictional pizza restaurant.

### Prototype 1

For the first half of this assignment, we needed to create a detailed visual prototype of the UI, using rudimentary presentation tools. The following interactive prototype was designed using Google Slides over the course of a month.

### Prototype 2

For the second half of this assignment, we implemented a portion of the first prototype using JavaFX, once again in only a few weeks.
